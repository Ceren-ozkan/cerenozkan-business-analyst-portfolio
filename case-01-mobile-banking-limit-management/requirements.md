# Case Study 01 – Mobile Banking Limit Management

## Overview

This case study focuses on improving the mobile banking transfer limit management feature. The goal is to allow customers to view their current transfer limits, request a limit increase, complete security verification, and track request status through mobile banking.

## Disclaimer

This is a fictional portfolio case study created with dummy data. No confidential bank data is used.

## Business Problem

Customers may have difficulty understanding their current EFT, FAST, and internal transfer limits. Requesting a limit increase can feel unclear, slow, or disconnected from the mobile banking experience.

This creates three main problems:

- Low transparency for customers
- Higher dependency on branch or call center support
- Risk of poor user experience during urgent transactions

## Goal

To design a clear and secure mobile banking limit management flow where customers can:

- View current transfer limits
- Request a limit increase
- Complete OTP / mobile approval verification
- Track request status
- View previous limit requests
